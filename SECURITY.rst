Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
----------------------------------

The security of this application is a priority.
All security vulnerabilities must be reported **privately and responsibly**.

Public disclosure of security issues, including but not limited to
GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, social media, blogs,
or third-party platforms, is strictly prohibited prior to
coordinated disclosure.

Reporting Method
----------------

All security reports must be submitted via email:

**Email:** <MohsenHasanNezhad@outlook.com>

Reports must include sufficient technical detail to permit verification and
assessment, including:

* A clear description of the vulnerability
* Conditions under which the vulnerability occurs
* Reproduction steps or proof of concept, where applicable
* An assessment of potential impact

Incomplete, vague, or speculative reports may be disregarded.


Supported Versions
------------------

Only the **latest officially released version** of this application is
supported for security updates.

No obligation exists to investigate or remediate vulnerabilities affecting:

* Older releases
* Forks or modified versions
* Unofficial builds or deployments
* Third-party integrations or environments

Response Policy
---------------

Security reports are reviewed on a **best-effort basis only**.

No guarantees are made regarding:

* Response times
* Validation timelines
* Patch availability
* Disclosure coordination outcomes

The developer reserves the sole discretion to determine whether a reported
issue constitutes a security vulnerability and whether
remediation is warranted.

Coordinated Disclosure Requirement
----------------------------------

This project follows a **coordinated disclosure policy**.

By submitting a security report, the reporter agrees to:

* Allow reasonable time for investigation and mitigation
* Refrain from any form of public disclosure without explicit written consent
* Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is strictly necessary to
  demonstrate its existence

Failure to comply with coordinated disclosure expectations may result in the
report being ignored and may expose the reporter to legal consequences
under applicable laws.

Scope, Use Restrictions, and Intent
-----------------------------------

This application is intended exclusively for
**lawful, ethical, and authorized use**.

The developer
**explicitly disclaims any intent, encouragement, or authorization** for
the use of this application in activities including, but not limited to:

* Unauthorized access to systems, services, or data
* Surveillance, profiling, or tracking of individuals without consent
* Collection, exposure, or exploitation of personal or sensitive information
* Any activity that violates privacy rights, local laws, or
  international regulations

Any use of this application for malicious, abusive, unethical, or illegal
purposes is **strictly forbidden**, falls entirely outside the intended
scope of the project, and is undertaken
**solely at the user's own risk and responsibility**.

The developer bears **no responsibility or liability** for damages, losses,
or legal consequences arising from misuse, abuse, or unlawful deployment
of this application.

Reports that focus on misuse scenarios rather than demonstrable security
flaws in the application itself may be rejected without response.

No Warranty
-----------

This application is provided **“as is”**, without warranty of any kind,
express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of security,
fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

The existence of a security policy does not imply any guarantee that
vulnerabilities will be discovered, reported, or resolved.

Acknowledgement of Good-Faith Research
--------------------------------------

Security researchers acting in good faith, within the boundaries of this
policy and applicable law, are acknowledged and appreciated. Such
acknowledgment does not imply acceptance of liability, obligation,
