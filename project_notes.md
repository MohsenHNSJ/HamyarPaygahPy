### Mission details response from server

When requesting mission details from server, the response is funny,
It's like they made it in a rush and never bothered to update.
I'm no Bill gates, but i at least try to use some tools to help me
program better and cleaner. They just made a bit messy shit. :/

- This value is unknown to me and has no value, therefore
it's not processed currently: ```<a:Ranande>-</a:Ranande>```

- This variable has mistyped name: ```<a:KMesidanBePaygah>```

- This variable is not fully pascal case named: ```<a:TahvilBedarmani>```

- This variable name is written in two languages! ```<a:BimarName>```

- This variable is for age but it also stores the word
"age" in it: ```<a:Age>```

- Instead of saving the gender in one variable,
it's saved on multiple boolean states:
```<a:IsMozakar>``` ```<a:IsMoanas>``` ```<a:IsNamoshakhas>```

- Mistyped variable name: ```<a:ShomareSerialParvade>```

- A simple yes or no question of wether the patient is an iranian
or not is saved in two boolean variables:
```<a:IsIrani>``` ```<a:IsGheirIrani>```
